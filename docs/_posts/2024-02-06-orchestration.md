Though technically distinct from timbre, orchestration is a closely related field of concern; most timbre scholars also study orchestration. These readings are some of the best for understanding orchestral music.

In Files on Teams, go to the folder `Week 4 musicxml files`. There you will find several orchestral scores in MusicXML format. (I downloaded these from MuseScore and didn't have time to rigorously investigate each of them, so be aware that there may be weirdnesses/mistakes in these scores. Nevertheless, I think this homework will be instructive!)

Go to [Orcheil](http://orcheil.ca), a tool developed to create orchestration visualizations like Dolan's. Choose one of the orchestral pieces available in xml format, preferably one that you know well. Generate a visualization using Orcheil by uploading the musicxml file (note that it may take several minutes for the visualization to be created). Experiment with the settings regarding dynamics and register, and see which combination of settings yields the most instructive graph for you and your piece.

Take a screenshot ([macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-a-screenshot-mh26782/mac), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learning-center/how-to-screenshot-windows-11)) of your favorite graph and add it to a document. Write 250–500 words analyzing the graph like Dolan might. 

Save the document (writing + image) as a PDF and upload to your homework submit folder.

Write ~500 words in which you compare the results of Wallmark's and Reymore's studies. Where do they align? Where do they diverge? And how do these studies reflect your own musical experience?

Prepare for the analysis symposium (instructions below!)

{{site.week7}}: Analysis Symposium

This week, we'll have no new readings. Instead, everyone will collaborate on an analysis project. We can discuss precisely what this will entail, but I am thinking of having us analyze one of my favorite orchestral pieces, *Rite of Spring* by Igor Stravinsky (1913).
