We'll close the class by studying my area of expertise of more closely: visual analysis of spectrograms. We will also discuss the relationship between timbre and genre.

This topic is here also because I am exceptionally busy these few weeks, between Holy Week and extra performances with my church job, and a "mini-residency" at Utah State University. My communication may be slower this week.
